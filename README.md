The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is a certification program that teaches penetration testing methodologies and the use of the tools and techniques required to complete a penetration test. The OSCP certification is awarded by Offensive Security, a company that provides information security training and certification.

To obtain the OSCP certification, candidates must complete a course and a practical examination called the "Penetration Testing with Kali Linux" (PWK) course. The PWK course covers topics such as network reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation, and it culminates in a 24-hour practical exam in which candidates must demonstrate their skills by completing a series of challenges and performing a live penetration test.

The OSCP certification is highly regarded in the information security industry and is considered a practical, hands-on qualification that demonstrates a candidate's ability to perform real-world penetration testing tasks.

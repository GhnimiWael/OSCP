The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is a certification program that teaches penetration testing methodologies and the use of the tools and techniques required to complete a penetration test. The OSCP certification is awarded by Offensive Security, a company that provides information security training and certification.

To obtain the OSCP certification, candidates must complete a course and a practical examination called the "Penetration Testing with Kali Linux" (PWK) course. The PWK course covers topics such as network reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation, and it culminates in a 24-hour practical exam in which candidates must demonstrate their skills by completing a series of challenges and performing a live penetration test.

The OSCP certification is highly regarded in the information security industry and is considered a practical, hands-on qualification that demonstrates a candidate's ability to perform real-world penetration testing tasks.

There are several "Linux boxes" on HTB, which are virtual machines running the Linux operating system that have vulnerabilities that you can exploit. These boxes range in difficulty from beginner to advanced, and they cover a variety of Linux distributions and versions.

To access the Linux boxes on HTB, you will need to sign up for an account on the platform and purchase a subscription. Once you have an account, you can browse the available boxes, select one to work on, and begin trying to exploit its vulnerabilities. You can use a variety of tools and techniques to complete the challenges and "hack" the box.
